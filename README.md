 5) Upload a random image and check if it's verified ;) 

(You can upload your own content and get a Hash in the Creators Hub (JPEG) (Sign up with a fictional Email). While it will create the Hash, we have disabeled the blockchain conenction due to API limits)

DocuLink is a blockchain-powered content authentication system that uses AI to generate unique hashes for digital media, ensuring verifiable authenticity and combating deepfakes. By running digital content—such as videos and images—through an AI-driven algorithm, DocuLink creates cryptographic hashes that are then securely stored on the blockchain. Anyone can later upload the same content to verify its authenticity and detect any alterations.

During the development of DocuLink, AI played a crucial role in enhancing content verification. Deep learning models were used to extract unique and resilient features from digital content, ensuring that minor modifications (such as compression or slight edits) did not invalidate the hash. To further strengthen authentication, I integrated computer vision techniques, allowing the system to analyze images and videos intelligently. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) was used to process metadata, descriptions, and other contextual elements, improving the reliability of content verification. By merging AI with blockchain, DocuLink provides a robust solution for content creators, journalists, and legal entities who require verifiable proof of authenticity.

This project was created 100% with AI Tools and human creativity.
